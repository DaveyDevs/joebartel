# About

Joe Bartel is an internationally beloved folk musician. With swift and direct lyricism and songwriting that can't be boxed neatly by genre, Joe and their band the Vandalia Cretins are one of the most handsome acts in the Twin Cities DIY scene. Their new album [*Executive Dysfunction*](https://joebartel.bandcamp.com/album/executive-dysfunction) is available now!!
